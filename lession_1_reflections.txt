How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I have used it earlier :p


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
I will try GIT ;)

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
because in google docs, other files don't change, unlike the case while coding.
